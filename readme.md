# Project 2: Out Side the Grid
## refelction of creation

This is my reflection on the process of creating a website using html and CSS. 

The topic that I have chosen for project two: outside the grid website, Is a team/clan website for the Call of Duty Mobile CODM app. I have been playing CODM when I get spare time, I have numerous friends that are from different states and countries for playing together as a team. By using brackets and the means of HTML and CSS coding with a focus on enhancing my knowledge and skills from project one.
Ensuring that the feedback was given and applied of the footer being placed in the body and the body and html codes are closed off. My focus for this project was to focus and concentrate on the ability to make it more responsive to mobile devices. As there are still some padding issues and overlapping of texts to fix, the website looks promising I believe.
By using netlify as my static site generator I can get the URL to look at my site, going further I could pay for a domain and fully register my site and have it up and going. I found this really useful as I could use the link and send it to CODM friends to get their feedback.

This project and subject has been really enjoyable and i will continue enhance my html and css in the future.
